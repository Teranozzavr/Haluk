                                Planning on selling? Our agents work overtime to make sure you are well taken care of. We believe that getting a head start and looking at the month you are looking to sell and reviewing historical selling trends will ensure that we come to market at just the right time. We perform a pre-list inspection to review the condition of your home and make recommendations for improvements before selling, so that you can be reassured that potential buyers will want to see themselves living there as well. Before going active to market, we sit with our clients and set the expectation of what the homes value is so you can be successful in getting moved out on time and abundantly happy with the outcome.
